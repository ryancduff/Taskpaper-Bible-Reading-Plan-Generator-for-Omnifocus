# Bible Reading Plan Taskpaper Generator

I love reading my Bible. I also use OmniFocus. To better manage my life and tasks, I like to keep my plan in OmniFocus as reminder and something I can check off. Taskpaper is a text file format that you can copy and paste directly into OmniFocus that will create a project and tasks as defined.

## How to use
Run the shell script in a terminal window. It will ask you for a few bits of information-- a Plan title, a start date to being the plan, and which plan you want to use. It will then generate a taskpaper file in the same folder that you can copy/paste into Omnifocus.

## Current Reading Plans
- 90 Day Whole Bible
- Psalms
- Proverbs
- New Testament except Revelation
- Gospels
