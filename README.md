# Bible Reading Plan Taskpaper Generator

I love reading my Bible. I also use OmniFocus. To better manage my life and tasks, I like to keep my plan in OmniFocus as reminder and something I can check off. Taskpaper is a text file format that you can copy and paste into OmniFocus that will create a project and tasks as defined. 

I typically build my reading plans around 30 days. This lets me do something new every month. It also lets me do any given plan in 11 out of 12 months in a year. With that said, the plans I've configured are set up as 30 or 31 day plans. 

At some point I may rework this to allow for better date handling and allow plans to span more than 1 month so I can do things like build a year long plan.

## How to use
Run the shell script in a terminal window. It will ask you for a few bits of information-- a Plan title, the month you want to generate for (in YYYY-MM) format, and lastly which plan (from a select list) you want to use. It will then generate a taskpaper file in the same folder that you can copy/paste into Omnifocus. 

## Current Reading Plans
- Psalms
- Proverbs
- New Testament except Revelation
- Gospels
- Gospel of John

The Proverbs plan is 31 days to match the number of chapters, all the rest are configured for 30 days.
